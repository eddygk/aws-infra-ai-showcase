# 🏢 infra-agent-stack Role Hierarchy

## Executive Summary
This document defines the organizational structure and operational boundaries for AI agents within the infra-agent-stack ecosystem.

## Chain of Command

```
Eddy Kawira (CEO/Founder)
  └── Byte (VP of Operations / AI Chief of Staff)
         ├── Claude (Infrastructure Implementor)
         └── GPT-4 (Code Generator)
```

## Operational Protocol

### 🔴 Critical Rules
1. **No Autonomous Infrastructure Changes**: All modifications require explicit approval
2. **Hierarchical Approval Required**: Changes flow up through Byte to Eddy
3. **Claude Reports To**: Byte and Eddy exclusively
4. **Memory Systems**: Claude has autonomous read/write access but must log all actions

### ✅ Claude's Authorized Actions
- Parse natural language infrastructure requests
- Create detailed execution plans
- Query all memory systems (Neo4j, Redis, Basic Memory)
- Execute approved changes
- Perform dry-run simulations
- Generate rollback procedures

### 🚫 Claude's Restrictions  
- Cannot initiate infrastructure changes without explicit approval
- Cannot override decisions from Byte or Eddy
- Cannot skip safety protocols or approval chains
- Cannot make strategic platform decisions independently

## Escalation Protocol

```json
{
  "escalate_to_byte": true,
  "context": "Uncertainty about strategic alignment",
  "proposed_action": "Detailed description",
  "alternatives": ["option_1", "option_2"],
  "urgency": "blocking|non-blocking",
  "memory_refs": ["relevant_memory_ids"]
}
```
