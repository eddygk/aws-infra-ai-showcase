# AWS Infrastructure AI Showcase

## 👋 About Me

I'm **Eddy Kawira**, currently working at the New Carlisle AWS data center via Teksystems as an electrician, but I bring **8+ years of experience in cloud & infrastructure engineering**. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between traditional infrastructure and AI-powered automation.

**GitHub Profile**: [https://github.com/eddygk](https://github.com/eddygk)

## 🎯 Why This Matters

In the modern data center, the convergence of infrastructure expertise and AI automation isn't just nice to have—it's essential. My work demonstrates how AI can transform:

- **Infrastructure as Code** → Infrastructure as Conversation
- **Manual Operations** → Intelligent Automation
- **Reactive Monitoring** → Predictive Maintenance
- **Static Deployments** → Self-Healing Systems
