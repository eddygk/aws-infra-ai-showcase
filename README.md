# AWS Infrastructure AI Showcase

## 👋 About Me

I'm **Eddy Kawira**, currently working at the New Carlisle AWS data center via Teksystems as an electrician, but I bring **8+ years of experience in cloud & infrastructure engineering**. I'm passionate about bridging the gap between traditional infrastructure and AI-powered automation.

**GitHub Profile**: [https://github.com/eddygk](https://github.com/eddygk)

## 🎯 Why This Matters

In the modern data center, the convergence of infrastructure expertise and AI automation isn't just nice to have—it's essential. My work demonstrates how AI can transform:

- **Infrastructure as Code** → Infrastructure as Conversation
- **Manual Operations** → Intelligent Automation  
- **Reactive Monitoring** → Predictive Maintenance
- **Static Deployments** → Self-Healing Systems

## 🏢 My AI Leadership Structure

I've developed a unique multi-agent architecture that mirrors enterprise organizational hierarchy:

```
Eddy Kawira (CEO/Visionary)
  └── Byte (VP of Operations / AI Executive Strategist)
         ├── Claude (Code Generator & Infrastructure Executor)
         └── GPT-4 (Supporting Analyst / Planning Assistant)
```

This structure ensures:
- **Strategic Alignment**: AI agents operate under clear leadership
- **Safety First**: No autonomous infrastructure changes without approval
- **Memory Persistence**: Unified memory system across all agents
- **Clear Accountability**: Each agent has defined roles and limitations

## 🖥️ Production Environment

My AI agents manage real infrastructure:

```
Proxmox Cluster:
├── node0
├── node1  
├── node2
├── node3
└── QDevice (Quorum tie-breaker)
```
