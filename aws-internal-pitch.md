### Email Body:

```
Hey [Name],

I'm Eddy Kawira, currently part of the electrical crew at the New Carlisle AWS 
data center (via Teksystems). While I'm hands-on with the physical infrastructure 
daily, I bring 8+ years of cloud and systems engineering experience and have been 
developing AI-augmented infrastructure tools that could add value to AWS's internal 
initiatives.

I've created several open-source projects that demonstrate practical AI applications 
for infrastructure management, including natural language interfaces for DevOps tasks 
and multi-agent systems for intelligent automation.

Given my unique position‚Äîunderstanding both the physical data center operations and 
advanced infrastructure automation‚ÄîI'd love to explore how I could contribute to 
your team's initiatives.

### Medium Version:
```
Hey team! üëã I'm Eddy Kawira, currently at the New Carlisle data center doing 
electrical work, but I have 8+ years in cloud/infrastructure engineering. 

I've been developing AI tools for infrastructure automation (think: natural 
language to Infrastructure as Code) and would love to contribute to internal 
AWS projects.

## üìù Follow-Up Template

```
Hi [Name],

Thanks for connecting! As mentioned, I'm exploring how AI can transform 
infrastructure operations. I've implemented several proof-of-concepts that 
demonstrate:

‚Ä¢ Natural language ‚Üí Infrastructure operations
‚Ä¢ Self-documenting, self-healing systems
‚Ä¢ Predictive analytics for capacity planning

Here's my GitHub showcase with working examples: 
https://github.com/eddygk/aws-infra-ai-showcase

Would you have 15 minutes next week to discuss how these concepts might 
apply to [their specific team/project]?

Best regards,
Eddy
